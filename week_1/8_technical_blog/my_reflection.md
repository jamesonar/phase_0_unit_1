Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I'm not entirely sure if this if hosting the blog HTML on GitHub is what's what's expected. Are we supposed to upload it to a server? All in all the process took significantly longer than I expected, but it was definitely worthwhile. I'd love to spend more time making the blog template look like a complete website, with a comments section and everything, but I'm short for time and I still have a lot of cathing up to do!
