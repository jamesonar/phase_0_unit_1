## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Ugh, Github was easy, but setting up GIT has been a huge pain. I thought I set it up correctly, but when I enter basic GIT comments, terminal returns "illegal instruction." This may be related to my use of OS 10.6. MY GPS teacher/guide was very helpful over the course of the day, suggesting that I try Homebrew, which in turn strongly recommends that I install Xcode. This is quickly becoming complicated and I hope to visit the Dev Bootcamp NYC site to get some in person help.

(2-3)GIT is a locally hosted piece of software that offers the same functionality for code that "track changes" does in microsoft word documents. It allows you to go back to earlier stages coding in case you make an error. It also allow multiple people to collaborate on coding projects by pushing and pulling code. GitHub is a third party website that hosts your code, allowing you to push and pull from a project, even when your colloborator's computer is off.

Developers use version control to coordinate efforts between multiple contributes, and when necessary, to revert to earlier drafts of a project.

Are there certain types projects that developers consider too sensitive to share with a third party like GitHub?
