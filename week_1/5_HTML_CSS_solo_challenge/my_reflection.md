I really struggled with psuedo class, first in understanding what they did, but the majority of the time was spent trying to figure out how to actually code them. Ultimately I found this source be be extremely valuable http://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.htm. I'm also still not sure I 100% understand the how relatively position items in html interact with each other. 

I'm still not sure how to test whether I'm correctly linking my html files to my css files. Stypi has be valuable in testing most of my code, but I can't use it to test this feature. As a result I suspect my files are incorrectly linked, but I don't know.

They were all new tricks! The psuedo class trick in particular combined with the :hover fucntion was paritcularly fun.

Regarding the learning competiencies, I can definitely position my HTML elements where I need to, but they sometimes act in unexpected ways, so trial and error is still necessary.

Getting extremely comfortable with divs and how they interact with CSS was a lot of fun

Figuring out exactly how to code psuedo classes. To provided materials didn't seem to demonstrate how EXACTLY to use it, smacked my forhead when I found out.
