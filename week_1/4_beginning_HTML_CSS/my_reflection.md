The idea that everything in HTML is nested within parameters made understand the concepts very simple. However, this week was the first time I've ever created a website, so I had a lot to learn and the process took me longer than it probably takes most.

Again, I think the nesting made HTML very simple to understand. On the downside, while I'm still new to this process, it seems like you can only create relatively simple, static site. I look forward to learning more about the true limits of HTML are and what languages can build on top of it

When I designed the my site, I first did you the whole thing in Sublime Text without seeing what the output would be. When I did my GPS using Stypi, I saw the huge benefit of being able to see the output of the code while your coding. In the future, I will rely on Stypi more heavily.

No, the sources provided were plenty. I'm will filling out details set of bookmarks based on your recommendations!
