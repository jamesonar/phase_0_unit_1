## 7. [Getting to know your group](7_get_to_know_your_group/readme.md)

Copy the email you sent to your group in this file.

So when I sent out my first introduction email, I thought it would just be nice to introduce myself. Little did I realize that I had that this was actually an assignment at the end of the first week. Well, I still have a long ways to go, but in four days I've gone accomplished most of the pre-phase 0 requirements (Socrates etc.) and week 1, so now it's on to week two. I'm leaving my job in a few days so I can really go full speed and catch up, but first, a proper, Dev Bootcamp-style introduction.

As I mentioned before, I'm currently in NYC. I moved here about 5 months ago for my fiance's job (my company's letting me work remote) and I'm still getting acquainted in the area. For my favorite websites, I went with Apple, Uber, and NYT. What's appealing about the first two is how much emphasis they put on creating an impression. Meanwhile, NYT does a great job of conveying tons information without feeling cluttered. I've spent a lot of time a horribly cluttered Chinese sites like this one (http://people.com.cn/) so I have special appreciation for well organized content. 

As for my learning style, according to VARK I'm multi-modal, but I generally like to just experiment on my own and only consult materials when I really hit a road block. As for Gregoric, I knew right from the outset that I was going to be Abstract Sequential, thought I admit I'm a little uncertain about how that will apply to my time with the program.

Finally, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be in a different email, but my biggest fear about Dev Bootcamp is that I won't be able to keep up. I'm starting behind and even phase 0 is pretty rigorous. This fear is further amplified by the fact that I've spent over a year preparing the GMAT and preparing applications and I'm turning down a few business schools to come here. This is probably not the place go into depth about the pros and cons of an MBA, and it's a very personal choice, but I'll just say fairly certain Dev Bootcamp will provide me better value and better people to work with :)

I'm really excited to be working with you guys.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
