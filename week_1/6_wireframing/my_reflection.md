 +I have some general experience with wireframing tools, so I have a basic understanding of the tools. What I learned was some of the finer points of design thinking. In particular I like thinking about the empathy, creativitiy, and rationality of a 
 +design as described by the wikipedia page
 +
 +Honestly, though I've never done it, I've always suspected that I would be a "back-end" developer. I find the concept of
 +user experience interesting, but the parts that I find interesting are the parts where you get to analyze data from user
 +experience experiments, not on the initial creation.
 +
 +I like the question "what is the goal of this site". I also found the Wireify tool a very handy one for generating wireframes of existing websites.
 +
 +Other than Wirify, I didn't learn many new tricks. Mostly it was a matter of learning some of the concepts of what drives
 +the creation of a website. The tutplus.com resource was a particularly helpful one.
 +
 +I'm pretty confident with the learning competencies for this challenge.
 +
 +I like reading the theory behind it, I didn't like actually creating the wireframes.
