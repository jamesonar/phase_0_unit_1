To created  repositiory on GitHub, you must first create an account on Github. Once that's completed and you're signed in, you'll see your username in the top right of the website. To the right of that, there is a plus sign with a drop down menu. In that menu, click "new repository". To clone the repository to your local computer, visit your newly created repository. On the far right, you'll see a list of options. On the bottom of this list, you'll find the buttom "Clone to Desktop"

Open source means that the source code for a piece of software is available to the public. It usually also means that the software is built by unpaid collaborators.

Utopia. It's fantastic that projects like Firefox and Linux can be built by the public.

The role of licenses is that they announce to other developers what restrictions you place on the use of your code. For example, if you do not want other people using your code for profit, you should pick a relevant license accordingly.

No aha moments. A point of frustration is that I cannot use GitHub software due to my operations system OS 10.6.

No other sources were valuable.
