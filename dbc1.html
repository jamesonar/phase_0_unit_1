    <p>I'm currently living in Brooklyn, NY, though I've been living in D.C., Columbus, and China in recent years. I joined a cyber security firm as a Chinese linguist 4 years ago (<a>http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjE5NDA3OTU2.html</a> and I recently left it as a jack-of-all-trades/expert-in-none product manager. During my time there, all the coolest work seemed to come from the web developers so I'm trying to join the club!</p> 
    <p>I also: <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>play soccer;</li>
        <li>play ultimate frisbee;</li>
        <li>have an <a href="home.html" target="https://muppet.wikia.com/"encyclopedic knowledge of the muppets </a>.<li
        I'm looking forward to working with you guys!</p>
