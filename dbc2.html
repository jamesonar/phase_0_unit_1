      <p>Welcome to our wedding page! This is just a draft of course, but ultimately we'd like to use 
      this page to provide information about our wedding to all of our future guests. Why not use a 
      standard wedding website service you say? Well because Alan's leaning to build websites that's 
      why!</p>
      
      <p>Also, did we metion that the wedding was going to be at a summer camp? Well it is. 
      Instead of bouqet throwing, we'll be doing stuff like this</br>
