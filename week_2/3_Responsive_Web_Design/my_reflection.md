# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* [ANSWER] Responsive web design is coding web pages so that they can adapt to various screen sizes. Given the spread of mobile devices, this seems like a particularly important feature. 
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* [ANSWER] As the interfaces for mobile devices continue to get smaller, web pages will become less prominent and the focus of web development will shift toward how to accurate target individuals for specific information.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* [ANSWER] What an interesting question. For those less impared, responsive design could enable well organized, zoomed in pages within a browser. For those more impared, I would assume that the answer would have to involve audio. However, due to file size issues, I suspect the best way to handle that would be to visually impared user use locally hosted software.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* [ANSWER] I'm very interested in the idea of media queries, but I'm still not sure how to use them.
* 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* [ANSWER] search for a couple of specific answers on stackoverflow
