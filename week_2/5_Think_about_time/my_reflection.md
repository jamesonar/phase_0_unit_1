# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


As someone who is trying to do phase 0 in half the time (while working, for now), my apporach may be a little bit different than most. I know that it's a complete dodge to say that the biggest challenge of my time management is that I don't have enough time, but it often feels that way. Instead of creating doing time boxing for work, I find myself boxing time for non-work. However, one thing that's hugely important is creating a calendar with bench marks so I can track my progress without getting to far behind. This will definitely be a struggle, but I'm keeping up so far! My goal is to finish Unit 1 by Saturday so that I completed Unit 2 by the following Sunday. Doing a full unit in a week will be tough, but I leave work halfway through so I can dedicate myself full-time.
