# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* [ANSWER] - See below
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* [ANSWER] The biggest problem I face with evaluating the value of the standards is that for the moment, I don't believed I've learned how to code anything that isn't in a standard format (if I'm understanding this correctly). So right now, I don't have anything to compare the standard to. However, if you're asking me if I understand the content from the two readings in this section, then yes, they make sense. I'll discuss one execption below.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* [ANSWER] I think I do... is the reason for the elements just so that developers can't name their divs and classes whatever they want? Unless I'm missing something, this seems pretty straightforward.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* [ANSWER] Because HTML comes with a default, unstated CSS. Reset.css clears away this CSS and lets you start from scratch.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* [ANSWER} Chrome. I've noticed sites can be different in other browsers. As a user, I don't care. As a developer, I imagine that can be very frustrating.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
