# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: https://github.com/jamesonar/-jamesonar-.github.io/blob/master/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* [ANSWER] I learned about the importance of creating a website that is stil user friendly on multiple screen sizes
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* [ANSWER] Nope, ultimately I think my preferences lie in doing backend work. I've always tended more toward analytical than artistic. Maybe if I get enough exposure to the "science" of user design, instead of just making asthetic choices, I'll get more excited about it.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* [ANSWER] Hoestly, I misued my time and spend a good 1/3 of the project trying to get the top three pictures to line up properly. I guess I'm still struggling with some of the mechanics arranging containers.  
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* [ANSWER] So many things! I would like to change the side bar into a menu header (current version seems like a terrible use of space). I'd also like to use media queries to prevent the header images from stacking innappropriately on small screen sizes. Also, for the life of me I can't figure out why the first paragraph is a link.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* [ANSWER] All of the response web design elements were pretty cool. For the first time I feel like I'm creating usable websites instead of static pictures.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* [ANSWER] Just googling a lot of specific answers, but no one source stood out.
