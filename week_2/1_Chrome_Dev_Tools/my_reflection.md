# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* ANSWER: In short, DOM enables a broader array of event-based functionality within a website. I'm still not sure I understand what the details are or how DOM related functions are fundamentally different than .hover and .read selectors, but it seems to add much more capability.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* ANSWER: The most obvious different appears to be that my GitHub repo doesn't contain any CSS. Instead it appears to be all html and other languages I'm less familiar with (java?). In contract, Wordpress has a large number of CSS classes, id's, and divs. Also, the presense of images on wordpress means there are many more links to outside content. As a result, Wordpress took a full 3 extra seconds to download all related content.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* ANSWER: SO HELPFUL! I was previously doing my html coding in stypi to preview my html code. Chrome Web Tools looks like a much better option. I'm also really looking forward to playing with the network tab more.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* ANSWER: Honestly, this was a relatively straightforward challenge.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* ANSWER: No
